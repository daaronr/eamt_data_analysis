## The trial

See full description in the gitbook [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/contexts-partner-organizations-trials/gwwc/giving-guides-+).

**Context**: Facebook advertisements on a range of audiences

> **Effective Giving Guide Lead Generation campaign** ... ran late November 2021 - January 2022. The objective of this campaign was to see whether a factual ['who researches giving' or 'magnitude of impact differences'] or cause-led approach was more cost-effective at getting people to fill out a form and give us their email in order to download our Effective Giving Guide.

### Treatments (text $\times$ video)

*There were two dimensions of treatment content:*

1.  **The texts displayed above the videos**

## Notes from the trial description

"In the original version of our test, we had 1 video for the factual appeal and 3 videos for the cause led approach - 1 for global health and development, 1 for animal welfare and 1 for climate change."

"We targeted our ads to audiences we thought were likely to engage based on their interests and demographics, and targeted the cause led videos to a relevant audience, i.e. climate change message to climate change audience."

"We also had various text above the videos that were displayed and optimized."

## Implementation & treatment assignment: key details


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Treatment assignment order, dates

The treatment assignment was determined by Facebook's algorithm. Video content was manipulated across three split tests.

Test 1 (Nov 30, 2021 – Dec 8, 2021) displayed either the long factual video or a cause focus video. In the cause focus condition, cause-specific audiences for animal rights, climate change, and poverty (based on their behavior on Facebook) were shown the relevant cause video.

Test 2 (add dates) was the same as Test 1 but used the short factual video instead of the cause-focus videos.

Test 3 (add dates) was the same as Test 2 but had a new version of the videos (with Luke just holding up signs with the words). This test was also restricted to 18-35 year olds.

Test 4: The Hypercube video was displayed in a separate “Hypercube” campaign which was tested against another campaign that allowed the algorithm to optimize between the 'short factual' and 'cause focus' videos (although not allowing each cause-specific audience to see the ads for other cause areas).

In all tests, the text content displayed above the video was determined by Facebook’s algorithm. Balance across variations was determined to equate budgets across split tests; otherwise, according to Facebook’s algorithm. All variation was done at the level of the impression.

The videos were adapted across the trials as we learned. First, we updated the factual video to be shorter for Trial 2, and then we tried videos of Luke holding up signs spelling out the voiceover in Trial 3 for all videos.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Data structure


The data frame `gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender` has one row per combination of 'campaign, ad, text, age group, gender'.

Each row represents a combination of the below (with different numbers of 'impressions' for each row)^[However, for the Hypercube campaign these are further broken up; I am not sure how.]

- `campaign_name`: When and and with what funds the ad was launched, I think (?)
- `ad_set`: An ad set can specifically tie an `ad_name` to an audience (I think)
- `ad_name`: Which video/media (or collection of optimized videos/media) was shown; note this is paired with 'which audience' in it's label, as there were specific 'global poverty', 'animal welfare',  'climate change', 'philanthropy' and 'retargeting' audiences
    - Caveat: The `ad_name` seems to select from a different set of media for optimization  depending on which `ad_set` it is in.^[In particular, it seems that for the `Giving Guide 2021 – PPCo Creatives` the `Emotional + Factual (Animated)` draws from a different set of ads for (e.g.) `Global Poverty + Lookalikes (18-39)` versus `Philanthropy + Lookalikes (18-39)`. I assume it draws from *all causes* for non-cause-linked audiences, but for the cause-linked audiences it draws only from the cause-of-interest, as well as the general 'factual' videos.]

- `text`: Which text was shown along with the video

- `age` (a range of ages)

- `gender` (female, male, unknown)

## Previous version of data used ... (updating)

We previously used data collapsed (breakdowns) by demography and ad set, into 2 files, which duplicated rows to represent  the number of impressions:  `video breakdown`, and  `text breakdown.csv`. We now use the more 'raw' minimal version of the data, avoiding duplicating rows where possible.

Below, we also input the 'old version' of the data, with the duplicated rows, to accommodate the old-format of analysis.  The code above inputs and builds 2-4 related data frames (tibbles), which were constructed from the collapsed (aggregated) data by multiplying rows according to observation counts. I am not sure where this was done. Once we update the rest we will get rid of this.

`gwwc_text_clicks`: Observations of link clicks ... by texts above video `gwwc_vid_clicks`: ... by video content


(We focus on the email results because we expect the 'clicks' are less meaningful.)

`gwwc_text_results`: Observations of emails provided ... by texts above video `gwwc_vid_results`: ... by video content

The files:

`textdata_dv_linkclicks.csv`, `videodata_dv_results.csv`, `textdata_dv_results.csv` , and `videodata_dv_linkclicks.csv`

are gitignored because of size.

## Descriptives

### Implemented treatments, impressions

First we illustrate 'where, when, and to whom' the different campaigns and treatments were shown (Facebook 'impressions').

The sequential campaigns involved different sets of videos, and these videos had different versions:

```{r impressions_count}

(
  impressions_campaign_theme <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
  dplyr::select(campaign_name, video_theme, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
  .kable(caption = "Campaign names and video themes: Impressions") %>%
  .kable_styling()
)

impressions_campaign_audience <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>% #created but not shown for now
  dplyr::select(campaign_name, audience, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
  .kable(caption = "Campaign names and audiences: Impressions") %>%
  .kable_styling()



(
  versions_of_videos <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
  dplyr::select(video_theme, version, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
  .kable(caption = "Versions of videos: Impressions") %>%
  .kable_styling()
)
```

Some audiences were profiled as associated with a certain cause (through their Facebook interests or activities): in 'cause-focused' campaigns they were shown videos  for their profiled cause. In campaigns that were not cause-focused, they were shown general interest videos. However, those associated with one cause were never shown videos for other causes.

Audience not åssociated with a cause included the 'General' audience, the Philanthropy (interested in charity) audience, a GWWC 'Lookalike' audience, and a Retargeted (?) audience: these were shown either the more general-interest videos or particular cause videos. Unfortunately, for these groups, when they were shown a cause-related video, we have not been able to extract the data on *which* cause-specific video they saw. This is illustrated in the table below.

```{r impressions_video_audience}

(
  impressions_video_audience <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    dplyr::select(video_theme, audience, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
    prop.table() %>%
    addmargins() %>% 
  .kable(caption = "Video themes by audience: share of impressions", digits=3) %>%
  .kable_styling()
)

```

The second treatment dimension -- text presented along with the video -- was allowed to vary independently of the video:

```{r impressions_video_text}

(
  impressions_video_text <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
  dplyr::select(video_theme, text_treat, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
        prop.table() %>% 
        addmargins() %>% 
  .kable(caption = "Video themes by text treatment: Impressions", digits=3) %>%
  .kable_styling()
)


(
  impressions_video_text <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
  dplyr::select(campaign_name, text_treat, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
        prop.table() %>% 
        addmargins() %>% 
  .kable(caption = "Text treatments by campaign: Impressions", digits=3) %>%
  .kable_styling()
)

```
However, note that treatment shares are not equal.  In fact, as the second table above shows, they are not even equal within each campaign. This is because Facebook optimizes to show videos and text more, the more successful they are.^[This also may lead FB to particularly combine certain message presentations more with certain video presentations. However we cannot check this in our current setup: it is confounded with 'audience profile' (at least in the data we can observe).]


### Demographics 

```{r}

(
  impressions_age_gender <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
  dplyr::select(age, gender, impressions) %>%
   uncount(weights = .$impressions) %>%
    dplyr::select(-impressions) %>%
   table %>%
    prop.table() %>% 
    addmargins() %>% 
  .kable(caption = "Impressions by Age and Gender", digits=2) %>%
  .kable_styling()
)

```
As can be clearly seen above, within all age groups, the ad was disproportionally shown to women. Relative to the [overall Facebook population](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187549/facebook-distribution-of-users-age-group-usa/#:~:text=As%20of%20June%202022%2C%2023.5,13%20to%2017%20years%20old) our data skews very slightly younger.^[But we essentially excluded the  13-17 age group.]


### Outcomes 

```{r campaign_date_outcomes}

base_results_sum <- function(df) {
    df %>%
     dplyr::summarize(
  Cost = sum(round(amount_spent_usd,0)),
      Impressions=sum(impressions),
      `Link clicks`=sum(link_clicks, na.rm = TRUE),
      Results=sum(results, na.rm = TRUE),
      `$/impr.` = round(Cost/Impressions,3),
      `$/click` = round(Cost/ `Link clicks`,1),
      `$/result` = round(Cost/Results,1),
      `Results/1k impr.` = round(Results*1000/Impressions,1)
)
     }

(
  campaign_date_outcomes <-  gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    group_by(campaign_name, starts) %>%
    rename('Campaign' = campaign_name) %>%
    filter(impressions>200) %>%
    base_results_sum %>%
    arrange(starts) %>%
    .kable(caption = "Results by Campaign and start date") %>%
    .kable_styling() %>%
    add_footnote("'False start' campaign dates with less than 200 impressions are excluded")
)

```



```{r age_gender_outcomes}
(
  age_outcomes <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    group_by(age) %>%
        filter(impressions>500) %>%
    base_results_sum() %>%
    .kable(caption = "Results by Age") %>%
    .kable_styling()
)

(
  gender_outcomes <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    group_by(gender) %>%
    base_results_sum() %>%
    .kable(caption = "Results by Gender") %>%
    .kable_styling()
)
```


Cost per click by audience (non-cause treatments):

```{r audience_outcomes}
(
  audience_outcomes <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    filter(audience=="Philanthropy") %>%
    group_by(video_theme) %>% 
    base_results_sum() %>%
    .kable(caption = "Results by Video theme for 'Philanthropy' audience") %>%
    .kable_styling()
)

(
  audience_outcomes <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    filter(str_det(campaign_name, "factual|hyper")) %>%
    group_by(text_treat) %>% 
    base_results_sum() %>%
    .kable(caption = "Results by text; later campaigns") %>%
    .kable_styling()
)


```
Above, we compare the text treatments for the later campaigns only. The earlier and later campaigns had a slightly different set of texts; combining across these risks confounding.
By ad text and by video:



```{r}


  
(
  audience_outcomes <- gg_campaign_by_ad_by_text_age_gender %>%
    group_by(audience) %>%
    filter(video_theme== "Animated" | video_theme== "Factual" ) %>%
    base_results_sum() %>%
    DT::datatable(caption = "Results by audience for non-cause videos") 
)

```

Above, we look at the performance of different audiences. As cause-specific audiences tend to be presented particular cause videos, we focus only on non-cause-related videos here for greater comparability. 

*Format note:* The table above is presented with the `Datatables` package/function. This allows sorting, filtering, etc. We can present more tables in this format if it is preferrable.

### In this context, how much does it cost to get a 'Result", i.e., to get a person to give their email to receive a Giving Guide? {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Cost per result (CpR) as the result of several processes...

How should we consider this outcome?    At the base level the Cost per Result ('CpR') for a 'segment' (a particular ad version, audience, campaign, etc), comes from several interrelated processes: 

1. How much FB charges us for this segment
2. Who FB serves this segment to (what types of people, how many)
3. How many people in that segment click and then 'convert', yielding a result

We could try to model each of these processes, but it could be very involved, and we don't fully observe or understand the second step, FB's optimization algorithm.

::: 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## CpR as a black box... 

Alternatively, we could think of the CpR for a segment as just a 'base outcome to model', and treat it as a sort of black box. This would suggests we have 'only one CpR coutcome per segment', and each segment has different characteristics ('features' or 'variables'), some in common. But that discards some important information: the mean values for segments with more observations (here, 'impressions') can be expected to have less variance (lower standard error), all else equal. 

:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## CpR as the average of a lot of black boxes... 

We can do something intermediate -- taking the aggregation into account, without fully building a structural model of the factors above.  Within each segment, we can consider the 'average cost per result' outcome for each individual as the expected value of a random draw. Each individual has some 'cost per impression', and some 'probability of a result'. The ratio of these is the individual's 'expected cost per result ... which we can also abstract as just some random draw. This may be considered as a function of 'all the characteristics of the segment the individual is in'. The CpR for the segment is thus an average of the CpR for all the individuals in the segment, and we can use 'regression weights' in our model to reflect this.

:::

<!-- Each segment has different observable preset characteristics: a particular combination of ad features, audience filter, time the campaign started, etc.

Segments also have different unobserved features: FB selectively chooses how to present the ad features, and to whom, and to how many people,  to maximize some outcome (considering an explore/exploit tradeoff). This makes some inference difficult.

But what I want to know is basically “which observable preset characteristics (the things we can control) yield the lowest CpR?“, and “how confident can I be in the relative differences in the CpR between these features?“.

It’s ~OK that some ad features may be more easily matched to amenable audiences, and thus we are  not learning ‘which performs better on a single group’. I might ~expect that whatever works best now, for whatever reason, will work better in the future.

I am thinking something like a linear (or log-linear) regression where
the CpR for the segment is the outcome
this is seen as a mean across observations, thus ~weighted by the size of the segment (number of impressions)
possibly a mixed model, allowing for some random effects? (But I’m not great at that).

-->



1. Present mean/Bayesian updating: 

- Overall cost/result 
   - and for different audiences
    - random effects?

[^gwwc_gg-3]

[^gwwc_gg-3]: Followup of interest: What do the 'diminishing returns to scale' look like here? How to measure? Can we track results over time and see if the cost increased? (But targeting may also improve over time.) Roughly compare 'small' and 'large' campaigns? ... 

### Which pre-defined audience yields a Result at the lowest cost? How does this cost vary by audience? {.unnumbered}

- Refer to models/estimates above

### Which pre-defined audience yields the highest 'rate of Result'? How does this vary by audience? {.unnumbered}

Note, this is not the same as the previous question because some audiences are more *costly* to target on Facebook.

-  Re-run above models for 'results per impression' 

Important caveat: this does not tell us the effect 'on a particular group', because of FB's optimization algorithms.

Interactions/separate models for 'vary by audience'.


### Which *video* yields a Result at the highest rate/lowest cost? {.unnumbered}

- Refer to models/estimates above, coefficient on 'video'


[^gwwc_gg-4]

[^gwwc_gg-4]: Check: is this the same as 'which yields the highest rate of results, or is there a cost difference?'


#### How does the 'best video' vary by audience? {.unnumbered}

- Include interactions in above model
- Run model separately for each group (or allowing everything to interact) for robustness
- Also consider 'what did FB serve to each group', assuming it is optimizing.

#### Aggregating: Which *category* of videos yields a result at the highest rate/lowest cost? ("Facts", "Cause focus", or "Arguments, rich content") {.unnumbered}

- Above, pooling videos of similar type. (Random effects models?)

### Which *message* yields a Result at the highest rate/lowest cost? {.unnumbered}

[^gwwc_gg-5]

[^gwwc_gg-5]: Check: is this the same as 'which yields the highest rate of results, or is there a cost difference?'

**Sub-questions**

#### How does the 'best message' vary by audience? {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Other questions (less interest or less feasible)

-   Do the message treatments 'interact' with the video treatments (i.e., are their synergies and better pairings)?

-   Do some videos lead to higher click rates?

-   Do some videos lead to higher watch rates?

### Defining the 'outcomes of interest' (as objects)

```{r targets, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#targets:
#bin_out <- c("d_don_1k", "d_don_10pct")

#num_out <- c('donation_c', 'don_av2_yr', 'l_don_c', "l_don_av_2yr", "don_share_inc_imp_bc5k", "donation_plan_c")
#targets <- c(bin_out, num_out)
#targets_short <- c("don_av2_yr", "don_share_inc_imp_bc5k", "d_don_1k")

#Note -- don_av2_yr is the right one for qpoisson as it already expresses things in exponents. l_don_av2_yr was the one to use in the loglinear model, which we are not emphasizing

#targets_short_names <- c("Log (Avg don +1)", "Don/Income", "Donated 1k+")
```

Next, we define the 'features of interest' and the 'controls'

```{r}

#features and controls
#geog <- c("where_live_cat", "city_cat")
#key_demog <- c("ln_age", "not_male_cat", "student_cat", "race_cat", geog)
#key_demog_n <- c("age_d2sd", "not_male_cat", "student_cat", "race_cat", geog)
